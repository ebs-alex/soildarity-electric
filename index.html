            <p>
                My name is Alex Moran, this is Solidarity Electric. 
                I have over 10 years experience in residential and commercial electrical work and am now in the process of obtaining a C-10 Electrical Contractors License; currently projected for July 2025. 
                In the meantime, Solidarity Electric will function as a an electrical handyman service for small electrical jobs under $500 as legally allowed by the State of California for a handyman. 
                Moreover, Solidarity Electric also offers consultation services for property owners looking for an second opinion on an electrical estimate or with help with finding an affordable, reputable licensed electrical contractor in their area. 
            </p>

            <h2>My vision for Solidarity Electric</h2>
            <p>
                Sooner rather than later I'll be saying "we at Solidarity Electric" as my goal here is not just to build an enterprise for the deployment of my own abilities, but a community of people, on the field and in the office, working transparently and with maximal camaraderie in a organization they can proudly and without reservation call their very own.  Many realize the traditional corporate model may be dated and sub-optimal, but when small scale electrical contractors (like myself) leave to start their own businesses their ability to  tap into and synergize collective efforts (that larger corporations still can meet due to their scale) suffer.  If the small time electrician does scale up usually you end up with not just the same traditional corporate model, but the same lack of true collective spirit as well. Perhaps Solidarity Electric might turn to a Co-Op model? That is a possibility, but initially & for simplicity's sake what I'll seek to create is something within the bounds of the modern legal corporate structure, a "new" model that fits in the confines of the old -- a model that succeeds in the creation of real material conditions for an authentic spirit of solidarity.
